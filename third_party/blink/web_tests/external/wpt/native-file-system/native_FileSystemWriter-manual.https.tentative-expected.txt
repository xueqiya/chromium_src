PASS write() with an empty blob to an empty file
PASS write() a blob to an empty file
PASS write() called with a blob and a valid offset
FAIL write() called with an invalid offset assert_unreached: Should have rejected: undefined Reached unreachable code

PASS createWriter() fails when parent directory is removed
PASS write() fails when parent directory is removed
PASS truncate() fails when parent directory is removed
PASS atomic writes: close() fails when parent directory is removed
PASS atomic writes: writers make atomic changes on close
PASS atomic writes: write() after close() fails
PASS atomic writes: truncate() after close() fails
PASS atomic writes: close() after close() fails
PASS atomic writes: only one close() operation may succeed
PASS createWriter({keepExistingData: true}): atomic writer initialized with source contents
PASS createWriter({keepExistingData: false}): atomic writer initialized with empty file
